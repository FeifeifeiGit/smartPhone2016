Call it fried chicken with a side of sentimentality and a pinch of potential frostbite.
Hundreds of people lined up in sub-zero temperatures for the grand opening of the famous Filipino fast-food chain Jollibee's first Canadian location.
The Winnipeggers were anxious for a chance to bite into the signature Chickenjoy fried chicken or sweet-style spaghetti mixed with ham, ground meat, and hot dog.
Ron Cantiveros, publisher of the Manitoba Filipino Journal, says that for those who grew up with Jollibee's, the brand's expansion to Winnipeg brings with it a dose of nostalgia.
