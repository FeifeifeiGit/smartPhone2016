After becoming a global star for playing Rey in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, actress Daisy Ridley has, at the age of 24, produced her first film - after she was told its subject, a female eagle hunter in Mongolia, would "remind her of Rey".
That film, The Eagle Huntress, directed by British journalist Otto Bell, has now made more than $1.5m (Â£1.2m) at the US box office in six weeks and is among the 15 documentaries in the running for this year's Oscars.
The real-life story, narrated by Ridley, follows the then 13-year-old Aisholpan as she trains with her father to become the first female eagle hunter in 12 generations of her family, breaking the centuries-old tradition that says the skill is handed down from father to son.
"When I was first sent the film, I ended up curled into a ball, crying and then calling my mum," Ridley recalls. " I was just completely blown away. And so I just had to call Otto and say, 'how can I help you?'"
