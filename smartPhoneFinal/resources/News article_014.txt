The Children’s Society helps change children’s stories, working towards a country where all children are free from disadvantage.

We’ve been trusted for over a century to drive change locally and nationally and provide support where it’s needed most. We base this vital work on the experiences of every child we help and the solid evidence we gather.

Every year, we work directly with more and more of the most disadvantaged children. We do this through our extensive network of frontline services, supported by an army of volunteers. Together, we tackle child poverty and neglect head on, from helping families trapped in debt, child runaways and young carers, to stopping child sexual exploitation.

We are brave in our actions: uncovering desperate situations, exposing injustice and addressing hard truths to improve children’s lives. Through our ambitious campaigns and determination to put children at the centre, we challenge misconceptions, change attitudes and influence government policy.

Since the day we were founded by Sunday school teacher Edward Rudolf, we’ve been at the forefront of pioneering change for children. We opened the UK’s first residential children’s care home and first safe house for runaways. We were instrumental in securing free school meals for all infant school children living in poverty.

Today, as always, we are ambitious for all children. We are determined, through our campaigning, commitment and care, to give every child the greatest possible chance in life.
