As cynics derided the popularity of Pokemon Go a few months ago, some tried to seek out the positives.
Sure, hundreds of millions of players were wandering around, eyes glued to smartphones, putting their energies into "catching" imaginary creatures in the augmented reality game.
And yes, okay, maybe the quest to "catch 'em all" meant they occasionally strayed into less-than-appropriate locations. Like Holocaust museums.
The risk of being so distracted while playing that you hurt yourself, or others, also proved very real.
But at least, said optimists, those players were getting a bit of exercise while doing it.
Now though, a study from Harvard University, published in the British Medical Journal suggests that the fitness boost was a short-lived phenomenon.
