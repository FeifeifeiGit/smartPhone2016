It was President Vladimir Putin himself who ordered Russian troops to oversee the evacuation of rebel fighters and their families from eastern Aleppo.
His call came after days of broken promises blamed on both sides. All day, Russian state television has been rolling pictures of the exodus, portraying a humanitarian act.
Russian officials have long claimed there was no "moderate" opposition to President Bashar al-Assad left in Aleppo.
So they hailed the city's recapture by Syrian government forces as a victory against terrorism. And as Western politicians decried war crimes there, President Putin's spokesman shrugged off such talk this week as "terrorist propaganda".
