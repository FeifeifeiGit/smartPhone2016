Simon Frith is stepping down from his role as chair Mercury Prize's judging panel after 25 years.

He revealed the news in a lengthy essay, saying he handed in his notice after Skepta won the award on 15 September.

The article then delves deep into the history of the award, describing how it has changed over the years. Most notably, Frith says the prize was created to lure lapsed music fans back into record shops. Nowadays, though, it tries to persuade young people to check out new music on streaming services.

Although Frith gives no explicit reason for his decision to quit, he does mention that the Prize was taken over by the music industry's trade body, the BPI, in 2013, after it lost its sponsor. 

"The starting principle of the prize was that it shouldn’t be run by the BPI," he says, explaining that the prize rewarded artistic merit rather than "marketing budgets".

However, he adds: "I can’t say, after serving two years under the new regime, that it has made any difference to the judging process or results, though the shift in power among the various institutions involved is clear (and I have no doubt that, as an event, the Prize will be marketed differently in the future)."
