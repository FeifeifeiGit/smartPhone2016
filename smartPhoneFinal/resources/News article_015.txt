The last major unknown region on Earth has just been surveyed: the South Pole.
Although the Americans have had a base at the bottom of the planet for decades, what lies underneath the thick ice there has been a mystery.
Now, European scientists have flown instruments back and forth across the pole to map its hidden depths.
As well as finding previously unknown valleys and mountains, the team says it has acquired important data that will have uses far from Antarctica.
Known as PolarGAP, the project was largely funded by the European Space Agency (Esa) to gather measurements over an area of Earth that its satellites cannot see, as they generally only fly up to about 83 degrees in latitude.
