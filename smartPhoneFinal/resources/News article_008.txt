Gold nanotechnology could help reduce the number of injections needed to treat a common form of blindness, researchers believe.
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of sight loss in the developed world.
Patients are usually treated with ongoing monthly injections directly into their eyes.
Australian and Chinese researchers believe gold nanoparticles could help better deliver drugs to the eye.
Their study, published this week in the chemistry journal Angewandte Chemie, tested how a hydrogel filled with gold nanoparticles reacted when exposed to light.
The researchers found the gel softened and released a dose of sight-restoring drug when it warmed by a only few degrees under the light. The process reversed when the light disappeared, hardening the gel and preventing the drug's delivery.
The biological activity of the protein-based drug was "highly retained" after its release, the study said.
What is AMD?
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a painless eye condition that causes you to lose central vision, usually in both eyes
This makes reading difficult, colours appear less vibrant and faces can be hard to recognise.
Peripheral vision remains unaffected, so while it won't cause complete blindness it is debilitating
AMD affects more than 600,000 people in the UK and is the leading cause of vision loss
It is more common with age and there are two main types - wet AMD and dry AMD
Dry AMD is the most common and least serious type and develops when cells at the back of the eye become damaged by the build-up of deposits
Wet AMD is more serious and develops when abnormal blood vessels form and damage the cells at the back of the eye
There is currently no cure for either type
