The Walking Dead star Sonequa Martin-Green has reportedly landed the lead role in the new Star Trek TV series.
She plays survivor Sasha Williams in the post-apocalyptic TV series, which is currently on its seventh season.
But the Star Trek role could mean Sasha's time on the show will come to an end.
And when it's a show about flesh-eating zombies, those ends don't tend to be particularly pleasant.
US publication Entertainment Weekly has reported the news, but Sonequa and CBS Television Studios (who are making Star Trek: Discovery) are yet to comment.

If confirmed, she will be the first African-American female to be the main character in a Star Trek TV series.
She is believed to be playing a lieutenant commander on the show, which will make this the first time a Star Trek show hasn't focused on a starship captain.
