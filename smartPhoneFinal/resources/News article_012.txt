Researcher Johan Basuki, from Australia's government-backed CSIRO, hoped the new drug delivery system would let AMD patients have injections less frequently - potentially once every six months.
"The idea is to develop a 'drug reservoir' that can be implanted in the eye and then use visible light to trigger the drug that is embedded in the hydrogel," Dr Basuki said.
"To do that we are using gold nanoparticles which have been known as a safe, inert, non-reactive component in the biomedical field."
Nanoparticles, typically 1000 times thinner than a human hair, are too small to see with a microscope.
The preliminary safety tests were conducted on rabbits, but further research is needed before human trials will be considered.
